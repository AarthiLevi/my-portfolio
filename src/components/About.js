          <p>
            Hi, Iâ€™m Aarthi, a passionate and creative front-end developer and designer with experience 
            in building visually engaging websites and user interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in HTML, CSS, and have a strong foundation in creating interactive designs using Figma. 
            I also have experience working with Unity for game development and immersive experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy combining my technical skills and design expertise to bring ideas to life, whether 
            it's a website, app, or digital experience. My focus is on clean, responsive designs 
            and seamless user experiences.
          </p>
